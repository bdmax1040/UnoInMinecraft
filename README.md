# Uno in Minecraft

## **IMPORTANT**

This is the core datapack that manages the running of Uno. This contains all of the custom scoreboards, commands, items & sounds as well as the general logistics in order to run the game.

**This datapack is DEPENDENT on having the 'UnoResources' resource pack installed in your game.**

## **Features List**

 - Contains a fully mapped deck of Uno cards (Number & Action Cards)

 - Custom commands to manage the game:
    - `/trigger starting_deck` - Gives you 9 cards to start the game with. There will be 5 number cards and 2 action cards guaranteed, and then 2 random cards to fill the deck to 9.
    - `/trigger clear_deck` - Clears all cards from your inventory
    - `/trigger last_card` - Shows a message in the action bar declaring that you are on your last card. This is the same as saying Uno in the card gane.
